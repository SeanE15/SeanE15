### Hi there, and welcome to my repository. This is a collection of the work that I creating while completing my HDip in Computing in Science in Data Analytics through ATU.

Some projects I'm particularly proud of: 

MachineLearning-Statistics: This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook of a project I completed on Fishers Iris Dataset - where I applied classification aogrithms and performed some statistical analysis on the dataset.
Also contianed in this repository are the tasks we were allocated every 2 weeks- which encapsulate what we were learning throughout the semester.

data_representation_project: This repository contains a project in which we were tasked with writing a program that creates and consumes RESTful APIs. We had to create a web application in Flask that has a RESTful API and link the app with one or more database tables. We then had to create a webpage that consumes the API (ie. perform CRUD operations). The final product is hosted on Python Anywhere, the link to which is in my repository README.

Programming_for_data_analysis_II: This repository contains a project on the wisconsin breast cancer dataset. I do a deep dive into the data itself along with applying and training machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of test samples, some of which are randomly generated and then comparing the accuracy of each ML and making recommendations.

If you have any questions hit me up please, 

I'm eager to learn more and looking forward to diving into more interesting and obscure datasets!

Thanks for reading!
